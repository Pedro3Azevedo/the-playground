\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This document presents a comprehensive specification of functional and non-functional requirements for a mobile basketball court management platform. The specification includes 31 functional requirements organized across 6 feature epics, and 21 non-functional requirements aligned with ISO/IEC 25010 quality standards. The requirements are structured using user-centered design principles, acceptance test-driven development (ATDD) methodology, and Agile practices.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
This document provides a detailed specification of all functional and non-functional requirements for the basketball court management platform. It serves as the primary reference for software development, testing, and project management activities.

\section{Scope}
The system is a mobile application designed for amateur basketball players to organize casual games, discover courts, and build a competitive ranking system. The application will be developed for both Android and iOS platforms using cross-platform development technologies.

\chapter{Functional Requirements/User Stories}

From the personas and the user scenarios, functional requirements were gathered. The Functional requirements, also called User Stories, were organized into groups or, as called in Scrum, Epics.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{Functional Requirements/User Stories}

From the personas and the user scenarios requirements where gather.
The Functional requirements, also called User Stories were organised into three groups or, as called in Scrum, Epics.
