# Mobile Application Development Cycle

## Introduction

In order to enable a systematic approach in development a successful mobile application, Tejas Vithani, member of the International Association of Engineers ([IAENG](https://www.iaeng.org/)) recommends using the _Mobile Application Development Lifecycle Model_ (MADLC), as mobile applications have complex features [reference].

In the paper _Modeling the Mobile Application Development Lifecycle_, Tejas Vithani and Anand Kumar, identify the following phases:

- Identification Phase;
- Design Phase;
- Development Phase;
- Testing Phase;
- Deployment Phase;
- Maintenance Phase.



## Identification Phase

This phase, which initiates the development of mobile applications, has the objective of collecting and categorized ideas.

A concept is created, a problem statement is articulated, and a preliminary research analysis is conducted. In addition, a competitive analysis is performed on existing applications with similar objectives, in order to compare their strongest and weakest features.

By the end of this phase, the principal requirements are expected to be documented.

Splitting this phase into tasks:

- Problem identification;
- Stakeholders identification and persona definition;
- User research and analysis;
- Market and competitive analysis;
- Initial functional requirements specification;
- Initial non-functional requirements specification;
- Constrains definition and MVP scoping.


## Design Phase

Once the concept is defined, the cycle proceeds to the Design Phase. At this stage, the target platforms the application are determined, and, as noted in the article[reference], a decision is made regarding the release model, whether free, trial or with paid.

The application features are organized into modules, and wireframes and prototypes are created to validate them. Furthermore,the functional and non-functional requirements are redefined and specified in detail, and the software architecture is defined.
An essential part of this phase is the design of the user flow and the creation of storyboards that describe the interaction between the user and the application.

Here are the tasks for this phase:

- Platform feasibility analysis;
- Business and release model definition (maybe not apply for the thesis);
- Refinement of functional requirements;
- Modular decomposition;
- Software architecture design;
- Prototype planning;
- Wireframing and user flow storyboard;
- UI for the different platforms.

## Development Phase

Now, it is time to code. Here the implementation will start by developing the different core features. Development will proceed in two main stages, coding the functional requirements and coding the user interface (UI) requirements.

It is important that the UI components across different operating systems maintain a consistent appearance and behaviour to ensure a seamless user experience.

The tasks in this phase will depend on the requirements defined in the early stages, but here are some common activities typically involved:

- Setting up the development environment;
- Implementing core functional modules;
- Developing user interface components;
- Integrate the frontend UI with the backend services;
- Writing unit and integration tests;
- Optimizing performance parameters.
- Preparing build artifacts and deployments packages.

## Prototyping Phase and Testing
With a prototype of the application developed, it is ready for testing and gathering feedback, before the full application is completed.
Feedback is gathered from clients, users or peers (depending on the context).

Based on the feedback received, another iteration is implemented to address and fix varous issues, improve usability, and refine features.
This cycle of development, prototyping and testing phases is repeated continuously until a final prototype that meets the project requirements.

These are the tasks for this phase:

- Preparing the prototype builds;
- Plan user testing sessions;
- Conduct usability testing;
- Analyse feedback and identify improvements;
- Implements prototype improvements;
- Integrate and build updated prototype.

## Deployment Phase

As the final prototype is tested and a good feedback is obtained, the application is ready to be deployed.
The application needs to be uploaded to the different store/market of the respective operating system.

In the article [reference], some tasks are recommended:

- Register as a developer in each OS developer's website (can have fees);
- Check the rules and regulations of the store;
- Refine the application (eg. removing all the log files and comments);
- Design the icon and the wallpaper to be used on the application store;
- Create the file format required on OS platform.

## Maintenance Phase

With the mobile application in the phones of the clients, ongoing maintenance is essential to ensure its stability, security and user satisfaction.
This phase involves collecting feedback to identify and address bugs, performance issues, and usability improvements. 
Regular updates are made to enhance features, improve the user interface, and apply security patches. If the application relies on backend servers, maintaining and updating the server infrastructure is also a crucial part of this phase.

## Conclusion

In the article[reference], it is reported that an industry-oriented application was successfully developed using the MADLC model.
The model facilitated effective planning and execution of the application involving various features. 
This demonstrates that the MADLC approach provides a robust and practical framework, making it a suitable methodology for the development of this thesis project.
