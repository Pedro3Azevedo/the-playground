# Mobile Application Development Cycle

## Introduction

In order to enable a systematic approach in development a successful mobile application, Tejas Vithani, member of the International Association of Engineers ([IAENG](https://www.iaeng.org/)) recommends using the _Mobile Application Development Lifecycle Model_ (MADLC), as mobile applications have complex features [reference].

In the paper _Modeling the Mobile Application Development Lifecycle_, Tejas Vithani and Anand Kumar, identify the following phases:

- Identification Phase;
- Design Phase;
- Development Phase;
- Testing Phase;
- Deployment Phase;
- Maintenance Phase.



## Identification Phase

This phase to start developing mobile applications, has the objective of collecting and categorized ideas.
A concept is created, a problem statement is articulated, a research analysis is conducted. Besides that, a competitive analysis is performed to applications in the market with similar objectives, in order to compare best and worst features.
In the end, it is expecting to be documented the principal requirements.
Splitting this phase into tasks there is:

- Problem identification;
- Stakeholders identification and Persona definition;
- User research and analysis;
- Market and competitive analysis;
- Functional requirements specification;
- Non-Functional requirements specification;
- Constrains definition and MVP scoping
