# User Tests

## Phase 1

Users will be testing how important are the features and define priorities. 
For this, users will be navigating through an interactive prototype, by following tasks.
After the tasks, users will make a Feature Prioritization Exercise with card sorting into: Essencial, Important, Nice to Have, Not Needed.
