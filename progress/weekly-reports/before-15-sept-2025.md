Before the classes started at 15 of september 2025, I began the project by writing a survey, that can be answerd in the following link:

In this survey, directed to people who plays baskeball either on a team or just casual games in public/private courts.
With this syrvey I can understand how basketball players uses the puiblic court, the frequency and the problems they have, in order to figure out the main features and priorities.

I also design a flyer to share the survey and intend to distribuite in several public courts:
